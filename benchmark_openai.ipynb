    "Example Response: \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scene 1: Initial View of the Road**\n",
    "- The road is divided with traffic cones placed along the center.\n",
    "- No visible parking signs yet.\n",
    "- The right side has a curb with some parked vehicles.\n",
    "- The left side appears to be an active lane of traffic with no visible parking spots.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Analysis:**\n",
    "- The right curb **might** allow parking, but no clear signs are visible.\n",
    "- The left curb is an active traffic lane, making it unlikely to be a legal parking spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scene 2: Closer to the Storefronts**\n",
    "- More traffic cones continue dividing the road.\n",
    "- Businesses and storefronts are visible on the right side.\n",
    "- A \"No Parking\" sign appears near the right curb.\n",
    "- Some vehicles are parked along the right curb.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Analysis:**\n",
    "- **Right curb:** The \"No Parking\" sign suggests that at least part of this section prohibits parking.\n",
    "- **Left curb:** No indication of parking spots; it remains an active lane.\n",
    "- **Possible conclusion:** The parked cars may be violating the rule or be in an exempted area beyond the visible sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scene 3: Passing the Storefronts**\n",
    "- More storefronts, including a **\"DONUTS\"** shop, are clearly visible.\n",
    "- The right curb still has cars parked.\n",
    "- The \"No Parking\" sign is still visible in the previous scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Analysis:**\n",
    "- **Right curb:** If the \"No Parking\" sign applies to the entire stretch, parking is **not allowed** here.\n",
    "- **Left curb:** No visible parking indicators or parked cars.\n",
    "- **Potential clarification:** If parking were allowed, there should be a sign indicating that.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scene 4: Turning Towards the White Car**\n",
    "- The camera angle shifts towards the right, showing a parked **white car**.\n",
    "- The sidewalk and store entrances are clearly visible.\n",
    "- The \"No Parking\" sign is not visible in this frame, but we saw it earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Analysis:**\n",
    "- The **right curb remains questionable**—the sign prohibits parking, yet cars are present.\n",
    "- The **left curb is still an active lane**, not a designated parking area.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scene 5: Moving Past the White Car**\n",
    "- The vehicle is driving past the **parked white car**.\n",
    "- The background shows a dimly lit residential area.\n",
    "- More \"No Parking\" signs appear in the distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Analysis:**\n",
    "- **Right curb:** The presence of \"No Parking\" signs suggests that parking is not allowed in these areas.\n",
    "- **Left curb:** Again, no visible signs allowing parking.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scene 6: Near the End of the Sequence**\n",
    "- The street is darker, with fewer businesses and more residential buildings.\n",
    "- A **\"No Parking\" sign is clearly visible** on the right curb.\n",
    "- Two orange construction cones are placed near the right curb.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Final Analysis:**\n",
    "- **Right curb:** The visible \"No Parking\" sign confirms that parking is **not allowed**.\n",
    "- **Left curb:** No markings or signs suggest it is legal to park there.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Verdict:**\n",
    "**Answer: A. No Parking Anywhere.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The **right curb** has \"No Parking\" signs in multiple locations, restricting legal parking.\n",
    "- The **left curb** remains an active traffic lane and has no indicators allowing parking.\n",
    "- The **parked cars may be in a zone beyond our field of view where parking is allowed, or they may be parked illegally**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the best and safest assumption is that parking is **not permitted anywhere** in this stretch of the road.\n",

      "- The distance appears to be **more than 20 meters**, possibly around **40 to 60 meters**.\n",

      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Scene 2:**\n",
      "- The ego vehicle maintains approximately the same distance from the red car.\n",

      "- There is a **divided road**, with the left side separated by a curb.\n",
      "- The right side has a curb with a bus stop nearby.\n",
      "- Road construction markers indicate lane adjustments, possibly limiting movement options.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Analysis:**\n",
      "- The **leftward direction appears to be blocked** by the curb and grass.\n",
      "- The **right side has a lane available**, but further down, there might be obstructions.\n",
      "- The **straight path is open**, but needs further evaluation for continued clearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",

      "- The construction barrels continue further into the path.\n",
      "- Signs ahead indicate possible detour or road closure.\n",
      "- The right lane seems obstructed with more barrels, potentially limiting a right turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Analysis:**\n",
      "- Driving **straight still seems possible**, but traffic control signs may indicate restrictions.\n",
      "- **Right turns may be unavailable due to the placement of barrels.**\n",
      "- There is **still no visible left turn available** due to the curb.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Scene 3: Increased Visibility of Warning Signs**\n",
      "- A **yellow sign ahead indicates instructions for drivers (e.g., speed reduction).**\n",
      "- A **\"ROAD CLOSED\" sign is visible in the distance.**\n",
      "- More barrels reinforce restrictions in different lanes.\n",

      "- If the **ROAD CLOSED sign pertains to straight-ahead traffic**, continuing might not be possible.\n",

      "- A **street sign on the right suggests a potential intersecting road**.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Analysis:**\n",
      "- **Straight is now completely blocked**, meaning that option is **no longer valid**.\n",
      "- The **right turn may be allowable at the intersection** but is still uncertain.\n",
      "- The **left turn remains impossible due to the curb.**\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",

      "- The **ROAD CLOSED sign confirms that straight is no longer an option**.\n",
      "- The **right turn onto a side street might be the only valid choice**.\n",
      "- The **leftward direction continues to be blocked**.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Final Conclusion:**\n",
      "- **Straight is no longer a valid option due to the closure.**\n",

      "- **A right turn may still be achievable if there is an intersection there.**\n",

      "✔ **A. Straight or right.**  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Straight is blocked ahead, but was previously available.**\n",
      "- **Right turn seems possible depending on an upcoming intersection.**\n",

      "\n",
      "### **Scene 1**\n",
      "- The camera shows the ego vehicle in a multi-lane road.\n",
      "- No clear visibility of a vehicle to the left.\n",
      "- The left lane is open and does not appear to be occupied.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Analysis:**\n",
      "- No immediate evidence of a vehicle to the left.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Scene 2**\n",
      "- The perspective remains similar to the previous, maintaining open visibility to the left.\n",
      "- No changes in road conditions or additional vehicles appearing on the left.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Analysis:**\n",
      "- Still no visible presence of a vehicle in the left lane.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Scene 3**\n",
      "- Similar road conditions, and visibility remains high.\n",

      "### **Scene 4**\n",
      "- The scene remains relatively unchanged.\n",
      "- The left lane remains seemingly unoccupied.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Analysis:**\n",
      "- The absence of vehicles persists.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Scene 5**\n",
      "- A vehicle **begins to appear in the left lane**.\n",
      "- Only a small portion of the vehicle is visible, indicating it was previously outside the frame.\n",

      "- There is **now** evidence of a vehicle in the left lane.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "### **Scene 6**\n",
      "- The vehicle on the left side becomes more apparent.\n",
      "- It is moving in parallel with the ego vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Analysis:**\n",
      "- Clear evidence of an adjacent vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Scene 7**\n",
      "- The vehicle is becoming more visible.\n",
      "- It is maintaining its position in the left lane.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Analysis:**\n",
      "- By now, it is **confirmed** that a vehicle was in the blind spot earlier, moving into clear visibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Scene 8**\n",
      "- The vehicle is now fully visible alongside the ego vehicle.\n",
      "- It is very close to the ego, confirming it has been present for a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Analysis:**\n",
      "- Strong confirmation that there **was** a vehicle to the left the entire time, likely outside initial frames.\n",

      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Final Verdict:**\n",
      "**Answer: A. Yes.**\n",
      "- The last few frames **definitively confirm** the presence of a vehicle to the left.\n",
      "- The vehicle was likely present before it became visible, meaning the initial frames lacked sufficient visibility rather than the vehicle being absent altogether.\n",
      "- Given the safety constraints, assuming a vehicle is present reduces risk.\n",

      "#### **Analysis:**\n",
      "- The ego vehicle is properly positioned at the stop line.\n",
      "- There is a **dedicated left-turn lane**, meaning a left turn is likely controlled by a signal.\n",

      "Example Response: \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Scene 1: Initial View of the Road**\n",
      "- The road is divided with traffic cones placed along the center.\n",
      "- No visible parking signs yet.\n",
      "- The right side has a curb with some parked vehicles.\n",
      "- The left side appears to be an active lane of traffic with no visible parking spots.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Analysis:**\n",
      "- The right curb **might** allow parking, but no clear signs are visible.\n",
      "- The left curb is an active traffic lane, making it unlikely to be a legal parking spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Scene 2: Closer to the Storefronts**\n",
      "- More traffic cones continue dividing the road.\n",
      "- Businesses and storefronts are visible on the right side.\n",
      "- A \"No Parking\" sign appears near the right curb.\n",
      "- Some vehicles are parked along the right curb.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Analysis:**\n",
      "- **Right curb:** The \"No Parking\" sign suggests that at least part of this section prohibits parking.\n",
      "- **Left curb:** No indication of parking spots; it remains an active lane.\n",
      "- **Possible conclusion:** The parked cars may be violating the rule or be in an exempted area beyond the visible sign.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Scene 3: Passing the Storefronts**\n",
      "- More storefronts, including a **\"DONUTS\"** shop, are clearly visible.\n",
      "- The right curb still has cars parked.\n",
      "- The \"No Parking\" sign is still visible in the previous scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Analysis:**\n",
      "- **Right curb:** If the \"No Parking\" sign applies to the entire stretch, parking is **not allowed** here.\n",
      "- **Left curb:** No visible parking indicators or parked cars.\n",
      "- **Potential clarification:** If parking were allowed, there should be a sign indicating that.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Scene 4: Turning Towards the White Car**\n",
      "- The camera angle shifts towards the right, showing a parked **white car**.\n",
      "- The sidewalk and store entrances are clearly visible.\n",
      "- The \"No Parking\" sign is not visible in this frame, but we saw it earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Analysis:**\n",
      "- The **right curb remains questionable**—the sign prohibits parking, yet cars are present.\n",
      "- The **left curb is still an active lane**, not a designated parking area.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Scene 5: Moving Past the White Car**\n",
      "- The vehicle is driving past the **parked white car**.\n",
      "- The background shows a dimly lit residential area.\n",
      "- More \"No Parking\" signs appear in the distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Analysis:**\n",
      "- **Right curb:** The presence of \"No Parking\" signs suggests that parking is not allowed in these areas.\n",
      "- **Left curb:** Again, no visible signs allowing parking.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Scene 6: Near the End of the Sequence**\n",
      "- The street is darker, with fewer businesses and more residential buildings.\n",
      "- A **\"No Parking\" sign is clearly visible** on the right curb.\n",
      "- Two orange construction cones are placed near the right curb.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Final Analysis:**\n",
      "- **Right curb:** The visible \"No Parking\" sign confirms that parking is **not allowed**.\n",
      "- **Left curb:** No markings or signs suggest it is legal to park there.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Final Verdict:**\n",
      "**Answer: A. No Parking Anywhere.**  \n",
      "\n",
      "- The **right curb** has \"No Parking\" signs in multiple locations, restricting legal parking.\n",
      "- The **left curb** remains an active traffic lane and has no indicators allowing parking.\n",
      "- The **parked cars may be in a zone beyond our field of view where parking is allowed, or they may be parked illegally**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the best and safest assumption is that parking is **not permitted anywhere** in this stretch of the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: A\n",

      "Number of images: 10\n",
      "### **Scene 1: Initial View of the Intersection**  \n",
      "- The traffic light is red, meaning ego must wait.  \n",
      "- A **\"YIELD TO PEDESTRIANS\"** sign is visible on the left side of the intersection.  \n",
      "- A **\"ALL TRAFFIC MUST TURN\"** sign is visible ahead on the right side of the intersection.  \n",
      "- A yellow road sign with arrows pointing left and right suggests that going straight is not an option.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Analysis:**  \n",
      "- The \"YIELD TO PEDESTRIANS\" sign means that even if ego had the right of way, caution would be needed for pedestrians crossing.  \n",
      "- The \"ALL TRAFFIC MUST TURN\" sign indicates that no vehicles are allowed to proceed straight through the intersection.  \n",
      "- The yellow directional sign reinforces this requirement.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Scene 2: Verifying the Restrictions**  \n",
      "- The traffic light is still red.  \n",
      "- The \"ALL TRAFFIC MUST TURN\" sign remains clearly visible.  \n",
      "- No additional indications that proceeding straight is legal.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Analysis:**  \n",
      "- No new information changes the assessment.  \n",
      "- Ego must turn rather than continuing straight.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Scene 3: Further Confirmation**  \n",
      "- The lights and signs remain unchanged.  \n",
      "- The \"ALL TRAFFIC MUST TURN\" sign is still visible.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Analysis:**  \n",
      "- The requirement to turn applies to ego’s lane, without exception.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Final Verdict:**  \n",
      "Since the sign explicitly states **\"ALL TRAFFIC MUST TURN\"**, ego **cannot** legally proceed straight through the intersection even when the light turns green.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer: D. No, there is a sign that says all traffic must turn.**\n",
