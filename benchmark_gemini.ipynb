    "### **Scene 2: Closer to the Storefronts**\n",
    "- More traffic cones continue dividing the road.\n",
    "- Businesses and storefronts are visible on the right side.\n",
    "- A \"No Parking\" sign appears near the right curb.\n",
    "- Some vehicles are parked along the right curb.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Analysis:**\n",
    "- **Right curb:** The \"No Parking\" sign suggests that at least part of this section prohibits parking.\n",
    "- **Left curb:** No indication of parking spots; it remains an active lane.\n",
    "- **Possible conclusion:** The parked cars may be violating the rule or be in an exempted area beyond the visible sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scene 3: Passing the Storefronts**\n",
    "- More storefronts, including a **\"DONUTS\"** shop, are clearly visible.\n",
    "- The right curb still has cars parked.\n",
    "- The \"No Parking\" sign is still visible in the previous scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Analysis:**\n",
    "- **Right curb:** If the \"No Parking\" sign applies to the entire stretch, parking is **not allowed** here.\n",
    "- **Left curb:** No visible parking indicators or parked cars.\n",
    "- **Potential clarification:** If parking were allowed, there should be a sign indicating that.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scene 4: Turning Towards the White Car**\n",
    "- The camera angle shifts towards the right, showing a parked **white car**.\n",
    "- The sidewalk and store entrances are clearly visible.\n",
    "- The \"No Parking\" sign is not visible in this frame, but we saw it earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Analysis:**\n",
    "- The **right curb remains questionable**—the sign prohibits parking, yet cars are present.\n",
    "- The **left curb is still an active lane**, not a designated parking area.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scene 5: Moving Past the White Car**\n",
    "- The vehicle is driving past the **parked white car**.\n",
    "- The background shows a dimly lit residential area.\n",
    "- More \"No Parking\" signs appear in the distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Analysis:**\n",
    "- **Right curb:** The presence of \"No Parking\" signs suggests that parking is not allowed in these areas.\n",
    "- **Left curb:** Again, no visible signs allowing parking.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scene 6: Near the End of the Sequence**\n",
    "- The street is darker, with fewer businesses and more residential buildings.\n",
    "- A **\"No Parking\" sign is clearly visible** on the right curb.\n",
    "- Two orange construction cones are placed near the right curb.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Final Analysis:**\n",
    "- **Right curb:** The visible \"No Parking\" sign confirms that parking is **not allowed**.\n",
    "- **Left curb:** No markings or signs suggest it is legal to park there.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Verdict:**\n",
    "**Answer: A. No Parking Anywhere.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The **right curb** has \"No Parking\" signs in multiple locations, restricting legal parking.\n",
    "- The **left curb** remains an active traffic lane and has no indicators allowing parking.\n",
    "- The **parked cars may be in a zone beyond our field of view where parking is allowed, or they may be parked illegally**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the best and safest assumption is that parking is **not permitted anywhere** in this stretch of the road.\n",
